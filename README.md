Polyhedral Symmetry
===================

A WebGL application that produces mathematical art. The app allows the user to create spherical paintings that illustrate the symmetries of the Platonic solids.

The app currently supports both rotational and rotational/mirror symmetries of the tetrahedron and octahedron/cube and rotational symmetries of the icosahedron. Color-reversing symmetries are possible with certain source images that have been pre-processed.
